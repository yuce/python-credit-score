Building a credit scorecard is a very typical industry-level problem, such as

1. evaluating a transaction or customerâ€™s credibility to perform further actions such as issuing a credit card or giving a balance transfer offer for high-credit customers in a credit card company,
2. giving promotions or premium rights to high-value customers in an e-commerce platform,
3. providing good customer segmentation to reach the right people in a marketing firm.

You need to build a system to score customers, and it has to be explainable to non-tech people, because when something goes wrong (False Alarm), you will know how to explain it to the manager/customer/business side.
